Subject: [PATCH 2/2] workaround: don't try to test
 egl_mesa_platform_surfaceless
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Errors like the following:
  undefined reference to `eglGetPlatformDisplay'
ocurr because those symbols are nowhere to be found in
libMali.so. Even though Mali defines a cousin of this
symbol (eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT), and because this is a very
specific test, it can be skipped altogether so that the build
continues given these symbols are not even included.
